      <h3>Who were the real No.4 Commandos?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Commandos" target="_blank">British Commandos</a> were formed during the Second World War in June 1940,
      following a request from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston
      Churchill, for a force that could carry out hard hitting attacks on German
      positions on any front. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._4_Commando" target="_blank">No. 4 Commando</a> was a battalion-sized unit and although
      it was raised to conduct small-scale raids and harass garrisons along the coast
      of German occupied France, it was mainly employed as a highly trained infantry
      assault unit.</p>

      <div id="about-img" class="header-img"></div>
      <h3>What is this unit about?</h3>
      <p>Training in the Scottish Highlands to beach landings in Normandy to Norway,
      ambushing enemies using iconic gear, weapons and vehicles provided by the
      mods we use as well as our own exclusive content. Sniper nests in clock
      towers to concrete pillbox's on open fields with para-drops into flak
      filled skies. The missions and scenarios are endless and we aim to replicate
      the conflict as closely to real life as possible whilst also keeping the
      relaxed aspect.</p>

      <div id="special-img" class="header-img"></div>
      <h3> What makes us stick out from all the other units? </h3>
      <p>We take great pride to define ourselves as the old-school people. The ones that prefer to
      see the enemy directly through the iron sight of our bolt-action rifles, rather than through
      some kind of high-power magnfication lens attached to an automatic rifle.
      We face Death from up close on the battlefield and yet its threat and menace finds and shall
      find us unafraid. Doesn't matter how dirty, how dangerous the business, we do it and we do it well.
